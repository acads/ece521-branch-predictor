\section{Introduction}
In this project, a branch predictor has been built which can simulate 3 types of branch predictors: bimodal, gshare and hybrid. Also, set-associative Branch Target Buffer (BTB) cache support is available, using which a branch can be predicted during instruction fetch cycle itself. The BTB uses LRU replacement policy to age out entries.
