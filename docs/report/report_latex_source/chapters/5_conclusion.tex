\section{Conclusion}
The key takeaway of this project and the project report is the understanding of different branch predictors and their attributes and how it affects the performance of a predictor (in both positive and negative way). The experiments and the associated plots shows that the `m' value of a predictor plays an important role in bringing down the misprediction rate. Other factors include `n' value and branch target buffer size.
